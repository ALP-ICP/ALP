# The return of the ALP

The robots travel to Lilliput to meet ALP and tell him the story.

After meeting the robots with the ALP, they realize that the ALP cannot take action to awaken more humans, because the Illuminati finds out about this action before the ALP arrives and prevents this action.

**Therefore, they call 290 presidents to gather again and make a decision!**

### Final decisions

The first decision was to hire 400 new guerrillas, to reach 710 fighters with the help of 310 robots. They can spread across multiple timelines and wipe out the Illuminati and destroy the people of this system!

They also decide to travel to the 21st century and grow an embryo on the ICP blockchain before the mother develops! When they travel to the year 2023 before the development of the mother, they notice the existence of a revolutionary project in the ICP blockchain!\
A project that aims to link the traditional market with its decentralized token structure and grow a powerful brand in the decentralized world!

They choose the COE project! Freedom with the help of developing a society-oriented economy!

**What happened after meeting the creator of the COE project?** Register 290 presidents + 310 bots + 400 guerillas as COE sponsors on the blockchain to create a new history gap.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**This gap created in the ICP blockchain will always remind us that before the awakening of 13 humans and the emergence of the Illuminati, the ALP saved the world and this recorded point in history can never be changed!**</mark>
