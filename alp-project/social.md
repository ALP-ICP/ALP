# üåê social

The ALP project consists of three main social networks that only the community can interact with the project in these social networks.

* **Gmail** : _a.liberal.president@gmail.com_
* **github :** [https://github.com/ALP-ICP/ALP](https://github.com/ALP-ICP/ALP)
* **twitter** : [https://twitter.com/ALP\_ICP](https://twitter.com/ALP\_ICP)
* **DSCVR** : [https://dscvr.one/p/alp](https://dscvr.one/p/alp)
* **OpenChat** : [https://oc.app/community/mefhp-xiaaa-aaaar-axd5a-cai/?ref=qyuam-wiaaa-aaaar-ajjba-cai](https://oc.app/community/mefhp-xiaaa-aaaar-axd5a-cai/?ref=qyuam-wiaaa-aaaar-ajjba-cai)

### **DSCVR**

The DSCVR social network is a creative idea with the aim of creating a social network in the ICP blockchain, where the community can create their own account with a Gmail account and complete their membership in the ALP portal. The community can keep ICP blockchain tokens and NFTs in this social network and use ALP NFTs as a key to enter the portal and participate.

### OpenChat

OpenChat is a social network and chat platform based entirely on the ICP blockchain. People can complete their membership with only one Gmail. Complete your membership and interact with other people in the ALP community, invite your friends and you will receive a significant reward if your friends buy a subscription.
