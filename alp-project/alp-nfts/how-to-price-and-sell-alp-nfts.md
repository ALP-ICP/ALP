# How to price and sell ALP NFTs

**The sale of ALP NFTs has been completed in two stages for whitelist members and buyers on Launchpad. All holders of ap-coe NFTs are placed on the whitelist and can buy NFTs with a 70% discount, although the opportunity to buy on the whitelist is very limited.**

### Pricing of ALP NFTs

The formation of the first DAO for the COE project will be aimed at pricing ALP NFTs!

Eight bid prices are proposed, and holders of COE tokens and ap-coe NFTs can participate in the first vote and confirm the price of ALP NFTs.



> **Further along the way, all necessary obligations will be recorded in the form of documents after implementation in the ALP white paper.**

### Completion of voting

76 active wallets participated in the voting and 542 voting powers have voted in favor of the final price of 7.8 ICP.
