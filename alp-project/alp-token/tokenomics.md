### Give more details

In the following, we will provide more detailed explanations about each part of the token distribution structure.

#### ALP/ICP trading pair pool

2% of the total liquidity of the ALP token along with 50% of the funds attracted from the sale of NFTs will be placed in a liquidity pool to enable trading of the ALP/ICP currency pair. The liquidity document of this trading pair is burned. The 0.3% transaction fee of this currency pair can never be withdrawn in Dex chain and acts like token burning.

#### ALP/COE trading pair pool

The remaining 50% of the funds raised will be used to purchase the COE token so that we can activate the ALP/COE trading pair.

**This is how it happens:** the COE project adds 1% of its liquidity to the backing of its trading pair with BABYAROF. In the next step, 50% of the funds attracted from the sale of ALP NFTs will be converted into BABYAROF and then converted into COEs, and finally, we paired the purchased COEs with 2% of the ALP token liquidity.

#### Holders of ALP NFTs

2% of the liquidity of ALP tokens is distributed among 290 NFTs.

#### COE/ALP pair farm

2% of ALP token liquidity will be distributed on the ICPswap platform with the help of the farm. Users can also use 0.3% Dex fee by providing liquidity for the ALP/COE trading pair.\
They can also upload the cash document in the farm and receive their deposit interest in the form of ALP.

#### Airdrop

1% of the liquidity of ALP tokens will be airdropped among the DSCVR user community... The aim of this airdrop is to increase the number of ALP token holders who can introduce more people to the ALP project like advertising.

#### ALP support in trading pairs with ICP

We will load 90% of ALP tokens into the ALP/ICP trading pair pool to add to the ALP backend and finally burn the liquidity document, then all these 90% will be tradable and TVL volume will increase as much as possible.\
This issue can assure the community that all ALP tokens are transparently available to the community and there is no concentration of power for the token.
