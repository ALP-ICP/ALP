## Making ALP animations

Making short animations in a surreal style was an idea that was implemented to create the added value of ALP NFTs. Mysterious scenarios that carry a message for society and promise a free future.

The scenarios of these short animations are written by AROF and a person with the nickname Zigool creatively transforms these scenarios into animation works.

Zigool is an Asian person who has many years of experience in making animation. After Zigool got acquainted with the ALP project, a friendly agreement was formed to start making animations with a surreal style in exchange for Zigool receiving 20% of the ALP development team's share.

_Zigool is a real person, you can follow more samples of this Asian artist on his social network: (_[_Instagram_](https://www.instagram.com/zigool/)_)_

**How does ALP enable time slots in the ICP blockchain? In the following, you can see short animations that clarify how this happens.**
