# The fourth part

## Second meeting in Japan

In the fourth episode of ALP animation, we see that ALP meets BABYAROF for the second time. The meeting in Japan was to review the status of the agreement. ALP gives BABYAROF the suitcase containing ICS. In return, BABYAROF also presents a coin from the ap-coe collection to ALP. These coins could create new opportunities down the road for the ALP. During this time, the ALP is always creating more time gaps to slow down the Illuminati's actions as much as possible.
